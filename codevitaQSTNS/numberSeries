Consider the below series:
0,0,2,1,4,2,6,3,8,4,10,5,12,6,14,7,16,8…
This series is a mixture of 2 series – all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in ascending order and every even term is derived from the previous term using the formula (x / 2).
Write a program to nd the Nth term in this series.
The value N in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term, no other characters/ string or message should be
written to STDOUT.
For example, if N=10, the 10thterm in the series is to be derived from the 9thterm in the series. The 9thterm is 8 so the 10thterm is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to STDOUT. You can assume that N will not exceed 20,000.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n,x,ans=0;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    if(n==1 || n==2)
    printf("0");
    else
    {
        if(n%2!=0)
        {
            ans=n-1;
        }
        else
        {
            ans=(n/2)-1;
        }

    }
    printf("%d",ans);
}

portal code:
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
 int n;
 scanf("%d",&n);
 if( n % 2 == 0 )
 printf("%d",(n-2)/2);
else printf("%d",n-1);
return 0;
}
