Count Pairs
Problem Description
Given an array of integers A, and an integer K find number of happy elements.
Element X is happy if there exists at least 1 element whose difference is less than Kie, an element X is happy, if there is another element in the range [X-K, X+K]
other than X itself.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= K <= 1045
0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
Input
First line contains two integers N and K where N is size of the array and Kis a number as described above
Second line contains N integers separated by space.
o/p
 count of happy elements
i/p:
n=6,k=3,a[n]={5,5,7,9,15,2}
o/P:
5
EXPLANATION:
        0 1 2 3 4  5
        5 5 7 9 15 2
        k=3
        5-3=2
        5+3=8 so range is[2,8]
        if anyone of array elmts lies b/w range(unclusive of borders) 5 is happy elmt
                     
//my soln
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int n=6,k=3,a[6]={5,5,7,9,15,2},count=0;
    int i,t1,t2,j,flag;
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
    {
        t1=a[i]-k;
        t2=a[i]+k;
        flag=0;
        for(j=0;j<n;j++)
        {
            if(a[j]>=t1 && a[j]<=t2)
            {
                flag++;
            }
        }
        if(flag>1)
            count++;
    }
}
