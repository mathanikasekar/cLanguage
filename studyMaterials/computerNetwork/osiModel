def:
 -Open System Interconnection
 -reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer
 moves through a physical medium
 to the software application in another computer

                                physical medium
COMPUTER A - s/w app - info  --------------------> s/w app - COMPUTER B
EX:watsap
 mathu-watsap-hi---->watsap-muhi

 -developed byInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984,
 -architectural model for the inter-computer communications.
 -7 layers
 -divides the whole task into seven smaller and manageable tasks.
 -Each layer is assigned a particular task.
 -Each layer is self-contained,so that task assigned to each layer can be performed independently.

CHARACTERISTICS:
 -upper layers and lower layers.
 -U-responsibilty of host-SPA
 -D-responsibilty of n/w-PDN

physical layer:

application layer:
 The application layer is present at the top of the OSI model.
 It is the layer through which users interact.
 It provides services to the user.
Protocols:
 FTP,HTTP,SMTP,POP,telnet

 ftp-file transfer Protocol
 http-hypertext transfer Protocol
 smtp-simple mail transfer Protocol
 telnet-TELecomunications NETwork.
 pop-

telnet:
 TELecomunications NETwork.
 used for managing the files on the internet
 Port number of telnet is 23.
FTP:
 file transfer protocol.
 It is the protocol that actually lets us transfer files.
 It can facilitate this between any two machines using it.
 But FTP is not just a protocol but it is also a program.
 promotes sharing of files via remote computers with reliable and efficient data transfer.
 Port number for FTP is 20 for data and 21 for control.
SMTP:
 part of the TCP/IP protocol.
 Using a process called “store and forward,” SMTP moves your email on and across networks
 It works closely with Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to send your communication to the right computer and email inbox.
 Port number for SMTP is 25.
SNMP:
Simple Network Management Protocol.
It gathers data by polling the devices on
the network from a management station at fixed or random intervals, requiring
them to disclose certain information.
It is a way that servers can share information about their current state,
and also a channel through which an administrate can modify pre-defined values.
Port number of SNMP is 161(TCP) and 162(UDP).
