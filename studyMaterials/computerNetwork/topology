topology
Words:
 in this arrangement
 dedicated link
 sender/receiver

topology:
 -Geometric representation of how the computers are connected to each other
 -secure/best=star topology   ********************

bus:
 devices are connected to a single linear cable called trunk/backbone/segment.
adv:
 -Easy installation
 -Less cables required
d.adv:
 -Difficultly in fault detection
 -limited nodes connected to backbone

star:
 each device in the network is connected to a central device called hub/centre controller
 no direct comm b/w nodes
 one device wants to send data to other device,
 it has to first send the data to hub
 then the hub transmit that data to the designated device
adv:
 -Less expensive
 -Easier to install
 -Less amount of cables required
 -Robust, if one link fails, other links will work just fine.
 -Easy fault detection
d.adv:
 -failure of hub leads to failure of entire s/m
 -Hub requires more resources and regular maintenance

mesh:
 each device is connected to every other device
 dedicated point-to-point link
 if there is n nodes
  -each node is connected with (n-1) nodes
  -total no of links=n(n-1)/2.
adv:
 -No data traffic issues
 -reliable(consistently good in quality or performance)
 -robust(well against attacks)
 -secure(unauthorized access is not possible)
 -easy fault detection
d.adv:
 high cable requirement
 scalability issue(large size)

ring:(repeater**************************)
 each device is connected with the two devices on either side of it
 each node has dedicated point to point links
 If a device wants to send data to another device
 it sends the data in one direction,
 each device in ring topology has a repeater,
 if the received data is intended for other device
 then repeater forwards this data until the intended device receives it.
adv:
 -Easy to install.
 -Managing/maintanence is easier
 -can easily add or remove a device
d.adv:
 -A link failure can fail the entire network as the signal will not travel forward due to failure.
 -Data traffic issues

hybrid:
 combination of 2 topology
adv:
 -scalability
d.adv:
 -Fault detection is difficult.
 -Installation is difficult.
 -Design is complex
 -maintenance is expensive.
