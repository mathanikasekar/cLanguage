Piggybacking:
 A-source
 B-destination
 if source need to send 50 Data
  A sends 5 at one time say(from 1001 to 1005) to B
  B sends ACK 1005 to A
  A sends data 1006 to 1010 with ACK 1005
  this is called piggybacking.
STEPS:
If station X has both data and acknowledgment to send,
it sends a data frame with the ack field containing the sequence number of the frame to be acknowledged.

If station X has only an acknowledgment to send,
it waits for a finite period of time to see whether a data frame is available to be sent.
If a data frame becomes available, then it piggybacks the acknowledgment with it.
Otherwise, it sends an ACK frame.

If station X has only a data frame to send,
it adds the last acknowledgment with it.
The station Y discards all duplicate acknowledgments.
station X may send the data frame with the ack field containing a bit combination denoting no acknowledgment.
