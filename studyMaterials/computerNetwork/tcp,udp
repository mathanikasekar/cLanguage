TCP:
 -connection establishement,maintainence(until application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages)
 -break data into PACKETS
 -sends/receive packets

SYN-initiate and establish a connection.
   helps to synchronize sequence numbers between devices.
ACK-confirm that other side received the SYN.
ACK/SYN-SYN message from local device and ACK of the earlier packet
FIN-terminate conn

STEPS:
Step 1: In the first step, the client establishes a connection with a server.
        It sends a segment with SYN and informs the server about the client should start communication,
        and with what should be its sequence number.
Step 2: In this step server responds to the client request with SYN-ACK signal set.
        ACK helps you to signify the response of segment that is received and
        SYN signifies what sequence number it should able to start with the segments.
Step 3: In this final step, the client acknowledges the response of the Server,
        and they both create a stable connection will begin the actual data transfer process.
UDP:


Checksum:
 value to verify integrity of a file/data transfer.
 a sum that checks the validity of data.
 compare two sets of data to make sure they are the same.
 For example, a basic checksum may simply be the number of bytes in a file
