1.Difference between C & C++:
 C-procedure oriented language(step by step approach)
 C++-both procedural and object oriented language.
 C-function driven language
 C++-object driven language.

Array:
 It is a collection of similar data items stored in the consecutive memory locations.
 Array index always starts with 0.
Types:
 1D array,multiDimensional array.
 1D array
 -it consists of only one row and one or more columns (or) consists of only one column and one or more rows. Eg: data type arrayName[int size];
 2D array
 -it consists of one or more rows and columns.Eg:data type arrayName[int size][int size];

Pointers:
 variable used to store address of another variable.
 used with call by reference. "*,&" opearators are used in implement pointers.
 int a--variable,int *a--pointer variable.
Types:
Null pointer-that points to nothing-->int *a=NULL;
Void pointer-it is not allied with any data types-->int x=10; void *a=&x;
Wild pointer-uninitialized pointers-->int *a;
Dangling pointer-points to deleted memory reference
Near pointer-used to store 16 bit addresses means within current segment on a 16 bit machine
Far pointer-it  is typically 32 bit that can access memory outside current segment

Array and structure:
 store same data type elements whereas structure is used to store elements of different datatypes.
 syntax: datatype array_name [int size]
        struct structure_name
        {
         members;
        }structure variable;

Union and structure:
 -Both are used to store elements of different data types but memory allocation in structure consists
 of memory size of all elements whereas in union element woth highest memory bytes is allocated.

macro:
 is a name given to a variable or small piece of code/block of program
 lifetime-throughout the program,no semicolon at end **********
 when i use the macros in program it replace macro name with its body/macro expression in that place
 to use multiple statement we can use \ at end of one line.
 # define-keyword
 #define PI 3.14                //PI should be capital,no semicolon at end
 #define MAX(a,b) (a>b)?(a):(b) //no semicolon at end,NO SPACE ALLOWED BETWEEN NAME AND PARAMETER
 #define SQR(x) (x*x)   crt
 #define SQR (x) x*x    wrong

Modifier:
 modify(either increase/decrease) memory size
 types:
 short
 long
 long long
 signed
 unsigned

Operators:
arithmetic opearators
 perform mathematical operations(=,-,*,/)
assignment opearators
 assign values to the variables(=,+=,-=,*=,/=)
relatioanl opearators
 used to compare values of two variables(>,<,>=,<=,==,!=)
logical opearators
 used to perform logical operations on given expression(&&,||,!)(AND,OR,NOT)
 returns true or false based on the condition
bitwise opearators
 decimal values are converted to binary values
 which are the sequence of bits and bitwise opeartor manipulate the bits

negative numbers
 are stored as it's 2's complement

Functions:
 a named set/block of statements executed when it is called
 reusable block of code
 enhance readability
 return_type function_name(data type parameters)
 {
 block of function
 }
inbuilt function:
 files within header files.
 printf,scanf(in built functions)

Functions:
 It is a set of statements that can perform specific task.
 It gives reusability and enhance readability.
 Without function call, a function can not execute.
 syntax:
 return_type function_name(datatype parameter)
 {
 //statements
 }
 example:
 int add(int a,int b)
 {
 return a+b;
 }

Memory allocation function:
  The memory allocation functions are used to allocate dynamic memory.

 The functions are
  malloc(),calloc(),reallco(),free().
 malloc()-used to allocate memory
 calloc()-it allocates memory and initialize the dynamic array with 0
 realloc()-it is used to resize the already created dynamic array.
 free()-it is used to delete the dynamically allocated memory space.

OOPS concept:

 class-it is a basic entity of object oriented program
 it is the user defined blueprint consists of set of data and methods. it is accessed using objects.
 object-it consists of states and behaviours. Using object we can access the members of class
 Inheritance-it is a mechanism by which the derieved class can inherit all the properties of base class and consists of its own properties.
 the keyword "extends" is used in inheritance.
 Encapsulation-It is the technique of wrapping up of data(variables) and operations on data(methods) in a single entity.
 Abstraction-It is the object oriented concept of hiding the implementation details and showing only essential informations.
