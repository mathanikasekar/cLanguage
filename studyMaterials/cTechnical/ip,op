-scanf(),printf()
-gets(),puts(),getch(),putch()

diff b/w scanf/gets:
 scanf() ends on encountering
  -whitespace
  -newline
  -end of file
whereas gets() not terminate for above mentioned parameters.

getc,getchar-std form
getch-non std ***************************

-getc():
reads a single character from a given input stream
and returns the corresponding integer value (typically ASCII value of read character) on success.
It returns EOF on failure.

getchar():
The difference between getc() and getchar() is getc() can read from any input stream,
but getchar() reads from standard input.
So getchar() is equivalent to getc(stdin).

getch():
getch() is a nonstandard function
present in conio.h header file which is mostly used by MS-DOS compilers like Turbo C.
It is not part of the C standard library or ISO C, nor is it defined by POSIX

getche()
non-standard function present in conio.h.
It reads a single character from the keyboard
and displays immediately on output screen without waiting for enter key.****************

printf, sprintf and fprintf:
printf():
 print character stream of data on stdout console
sprintf():
  instead of printing on console store it on char buffer
fprintf():
  print the string content in file but not on stdout console

  #include<stdio.h>
  int main()
  {

  int n;
  printf("Enter number");
  n=getchar();
  putchar(n);

  char ch;
  printf("Enter character");
  ch=getch();
  putch(ch);

  char s[20];
  printf("Enter string");
  gets(s);
  puts(s);
  return 0;

  }
