Pointers In C:

What Is A Pointer?

-variable store the address of a variable.
-use: points to the memory location of the variable whose address is provided.
 This property helps in Dynamic memory allocation, which is an important aspect of programming.

syntax:
Data_Type *pointer_name;   Example: int *ptr;

Reference And De-Reference Operators:
-Reference Operators:
  Address of’ operator (ampersand)
  returns memory location/address of the given variable.
   int *ptr;
   int a;
   ptr = &a;
   The address of variable ‘a’ is stored in variable ptr.
-De-Reference Operators:
‘Value at’ operator asterisk (*).
 retrieving the value from the memory location which is stored in the pointer variable

int *ptr;
int a;
*ptr = &a;
printf("Value of a = %dn", *ptr);

MY EXAMPLE:

# include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a=5;
    int *p1=&a;
    int **p2=&p1;
    printf("%d\n",a);   // value stored in a
    printf("%d\n",p1);  // value  stored in p1(address of a)
    printf("%d\n",*p1); // value present in address stored in p1
    printf("%d\n",p2);  // value  stored in p2(address of p1)
    printf("%d\n",*p2); // value present in address stored in p2(address of a)
    printf("%d\n",**p2);//value present in address stored by p1 i.e,value of a
}
