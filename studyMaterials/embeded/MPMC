MP/MC
 mp:ALU,Stack pointer,clocking unit
 mc:single chip consist of all pheripherals

 processor:
  process something
  four primary functions of a processor-fetch, decode, execute and write back.
  Fetch- receives instructions from program memory from a systems RAM.
  Decode-decide what instruction means
  Execute- is where the operation is performed.
  WriteBack- storage method in which data is written into the cache every time a change occurs,
  but is written  main memory only at specified intervals or under certain conditions.
