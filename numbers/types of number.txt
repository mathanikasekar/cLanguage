Different Type of Numbers:- 

1. Natural Numbers

2. Whole Numbers

3. Integers

4. Even Numbers

5. Odd Numbers

6. Prime Numbers

7. Composite Numbers

Natural Numbers:-
Counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, are called Natural Numbers.

Whole Numbers:- 
All counting numbers together with zero forms the set of whole numbers. Thus,

  *** 0 is the only whole number which is not a natural number.
 Every natural number is a whole number. ***
 
Integers:- 
All natural numbers, 0 and negatives of counting numbers i.e., { ...... -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...........} together form the set of integers.

Positive Integers:- 
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .... } is the set of all positive integers.

Negative Integers:-
{-1, -2, -3, -4, ......} is the set of all negative integers.

Non-Positive and Non-Negative Integers:- 
0 is neither positive nor negative. So, {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...} represents the set of non-negative integers, while {0, -1, -2, -3, -4, .....} represents the set of non-positive integers.

Different Type of Numbers

Even Numbers:-
A number divisible by 2 is called an even number. eg, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 etc.,
