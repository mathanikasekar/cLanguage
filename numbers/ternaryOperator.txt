General Form:

(expression_1) ? (expression_2) : (expression_3);

(condition/comparison) ? (true) : (false);

expression_1 is a comparison/conditional argument.
expression_2 is executed/returned if expression_1 results in true,
expression_3 gets executed/returned if expression_1 is false.


#include < stdio.h >
int main()
{
 int a = 1, b = 1, c;

 // (expression1) ? (expression2) : (expression3);

  (a+b) ? (c = 10) : (c = 20);
   printf("Value of C is %d\n", c);
   return 0;
}
Output:
Value of C is 10

a+b is 2 which is non-zero,
so it is considered as true.
So c = 10 gets executed.

#include < stdio.h >
int main()
{
 int a = 1, b = 1, c;

 // (expression1) ? (expression2) : (expression3);

  (a-b) ? (c = 10) : (c = 20);
  printf("Value of C is %d\n", c);
  return 0;
}
Output:
Value of C is 20

a-b is 0 which is zero,
so it is considered as false.
So c = 20 gets executed.

#include < stdio.h >

int main()
{
 int a = 1, b = 1, c;

 // (expression1) ? (expression2) : (expression3);

  *** c = (a+b) ? (10) : (20);
  printf("Value of C is %d\n", c);
  return 0;
}
Output:
Value of C is 10

BIGGEST OF THREE and FOUR NUMBER:

# include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b,c,d,big1,big2 ;
    printf("Enter three numbers : ") ;
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &a, &b, &c, &d) ;
    big1 = a > b ? (a > c ? a : c) : (b > c ? b : c) ;
    big2=(a > b && a > c && a > d)? a :((b > c && b > d) ? b : (( c > d) ? c : d ));
    printf("\nThe biggest number is : %d", big) ;
}
