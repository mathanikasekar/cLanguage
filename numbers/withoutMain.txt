Logically it’s seems impossible to write a C program without using a main() function. Since every program must have a main() function because:-

It’s an entry point of every C/C++ program.
All Predefined and User-defined Functions are called directly or indirectly through the main.
Therefore we will use preprocessor(a program which processes the source code before compilation) directive #define with arguments to give an impression that the program runs without main. But in reality it runs with a hidden main function. Let’s see how the preprocessor doing their job:-
Hence it can be solved in following ways:-

Using a macro that defines main

#include<stdio.h> 
#define fun main 
int fun(void) 
{ 
    printf("deva"); 
    return 0; 
}
Output:deva

Using Token-Pasting Operator

The above solution has word ‘main’ in it. If we are not allowed to even write main, we can use token-pasting operator (see this for details)

#include<stdio.h> 
#define fun m##a##i##n 
int fun() 
{ 
    printf("deva"); 
    return 0; 
}
Output: deva
