RED BLACK TREE:
self balancing BST
Step 1 - Check whether tree is Empty.
Step 2 - If tree is Empty then insert the newNode as Root node with color Black and exit from the operation.
Step 3 - If tree is not Empty then insert the newNode as leaf node with color Red.
Step 4 - If the parent of newNode is Black then exit from the operation.
Step 5 - If the parent of newNode is Red then check the color of parentnode's sibling of newNode.
Step 6 - If it is colored Black or NULL then make suitable Rotation and Recolor it.
Step 7 - If it is colored Red then perform Recolor. Repeat the same until tree becomes Red Black Tree.
no two nodes should be consecutively red
: if it so..(parent red child also red-->recolor parent to blk color)
