James found a love letter his friend Harry has written for his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.

To do this, he follows 2 rules:

(a) He can reduce the value of a letter, e.g. he can change 'd' to 'c', but he cannot change 'c' to 'd'. (b) In order to form a palindrome, if he has to repeatedly reduce the value of a letter, he can do it until the letter becomes 'a'. Once a letter has been changed to 'a', it can no longer be changed.

Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.

Input Format The first line contains an integer T, i.e., the number of test cases. The next T lines will contain a string each. The strings do not contain any spaces.

Output Format A single line containing the number of minimum operations corresponding to each test case.

Constraints 1 ≤ T ≤ 10 1 ≤ length of string ≤ 104 All characters are lower case English letters.

        printf("L is: %d\n",l);

            printf("first char is is: %c\n",string[j]);

                int g = (int)(string[j] - string[k-j-1]);
                if ( g > 0){
                    result += g;
                }
                else{
                    result -= g;
                }

Sample Input #00

4
abc
abcba
abcd
cba
Sample Output #00

2
0
4
2
Explanation

For the first test case, abc -> abb -> aba. For the second test case, abcba is already palindromic string. For the third test case, abcd -> abcc -> abcb -> abca = abca -> abba. For the fourth test case, cba -> bba -> aba.

The above stated code is working for the given sample input, but it is not the correct one according to hacckerrank. Can someone point out the error please?
